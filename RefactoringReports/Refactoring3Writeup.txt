1. What needed to be improgved? I.e. What was the "bad code smell"?
    - The "bad smell" was Large Class

2. What refactoring was applied? 
    - Extract Class
    - Steps:
    Step 1: Decide how to split the responsibilities of the class. 
    Step 2: Create a new class to express the split-off responsibilities.
        Step 2a: If the responsibilities of the old class no longer match it's name, rename the old class.
    Step 3: Make a link from the old class to the new class
    Step 4: Use move field on each field that must be moved
    Step 5: Use move method on each method that must be must be moved
    Step 6: Compile and test after each move
    Step 7: Review and reduce the interfaces of each class
    Step 8: Decide whether to expose the new class, 
        Step 8a: If yes, decide whether to expose as a reference object or as an immutable value object
    Step 9:
    
3. How was the code tested?
    - Unit tested iteratively thoughout the refactoring process
    
4. Does the Result of the refactoring suggest or enable further refactorings?
    - Yes, now that the class "Host" has been extracted from the callUrlCache it is quite obvious that the method beginDownloadStream could reduce the amount of parameters by simply passing a "Host" object. The refactoring method "Introduce Parameter Object" will be applied in Refactoring_4 which will result in 2 parameters vs 5.
